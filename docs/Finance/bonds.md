## Bond funds (fromb Bogleheads)

- unlike an individual bond, the NAV of a fund does not automatically return to
  par on a specified date.
- the price at which you will be able to sell shares of a bond fund cannot be
  known ahead of time
- if you own an individual bond, each year its market value (its price) moves
  one year closer to par

People should hold bond funds (high grade, short or intermediate term, and a
mix of nominal and inflation-adjusted), and just ignore the NAV. All that
matters is total return, and if you hold the fund longer than the duration,
your total return will be just fine

## Duration

"It is the payment-weighted point in time at which an investor can expect to
recoup his or her original investment."

Bond funds maintain a fairly constant duration.

The "point of indifference" for the owner of a bond fund in dealing with
interest rate changes

  - If interest rates rise after purchasing a bond fund, the NAV of the fund
    falls, which hurts the investor

  - However, the dividends that the bond fund throws off can now be reinvested
    at a higher rate

  - **The duration is the length of time that an investor needs to hold the
    fund for the increased yields to compensate for the decrease in NAV**

  - duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of
    the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have
    been worth had interest rates not risen

  -  as the time when you will need the money approaches, you must reduce your
     duration accordingly, to protect you against any further increases in
     prevailing rate

Principal (or face value, or face value) = original sum of money borrowed in a
loan.
