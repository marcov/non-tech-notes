### Alcohol

There is no minimum safe amount. Even small doses have negative impacts.

Effect of moderate alcohol consumption

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15166654

RESULTS:
Moderate alcohol consumption increased plasma DHEAS level by 16.5% (95%
confidence interval, 8.0-24.9), with similar changes for men and women. Plasma
testosterone level decreased in men by 6.8% (95% confidence interval, -1.0-
-12.5), but no effect was found in women. Plasma estradiol level was not
affected. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased by 11.7%
(95% confidence interval, 7.3-16.0), with similar changes for men and women. The
overall alcohol-induced relative changes in DHEAS, testosterone, and estradiol
correlated positively with the relative increase in high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (adjusted for the relative change in body weight); however, findings
were only borderline significant for DHEAS and estradiol (r = 0.44, p = 0.08; r
= 0.32, p = 0.21; and r = 0.46, p = 0.06, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS:
A protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption for cardiovascular disease
risk may in part be explained by increased plasma DHEAS level.

### Natural Supps

Lemon Balm (or Melissa officianalis)
