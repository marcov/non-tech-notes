- Rowing

To coach yourself, remember: Weight on heels, load the posterior chain, elbows
back to activate lats, scapula down to engage upper back, bar lowered directly
below knees, pull bar into the lower abs. It's not that hard. Now row some big
weights.

- Saphenous Nerve Entrapment Neuropathy: http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=40242

    * Sometimes reaching as far as the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great
      toe.

    * Mechanisms for production of saphenous nerve neuropathy may be
      nontraumatic, traumatic, or post-surgical. Due to the angulation of the
      saphenous nerve over the sartorius muscle tendon after exiting from the
      adductor canal, traction on the nerve may be produced by limb movement
      leading to inflammation, edema, and paresthesia.3

- Triceps + ABS together:

They're basically leaning triceps pushdowns. To do these, step away from the
cable a few feet rather than being close to it. From there, push out and down
into your abs. If you do this correctly, you'll create tremendous tension
through the abs and force them to stabilize really hard. Plus you're working
pipes while doing it, and big pipes get about as much attention as rock-hard
abs.
