# Carbs for cycling

- 30g is plenty for Z2.

High intensity:

- Start 50g/h

- Go up to 110g/h - do 15 grams increments and you step up when you tolerate it.

- Go with smaller amounts more often - like every 30 minutes or shorter. Start at the first 30 minutes.

- Make sure to add enough liquids to favor digestion.

- Once over 60g needs to include two different form:
  * 2 (multi-directional?) glucose : 1 part fructose

- Brands:
  * SIS
  * BETA FUEL
  * MAURTEN
  * INFINITE

- Hidrogels
