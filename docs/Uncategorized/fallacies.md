## Anecdotal Evidence
Evidence from anecdotes, collected in a casual or informal manner, relying on
personal testimony.

## Confirmation Bias
Only search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms
or supports one's prior beliefs or values.

## Schrodinger Claim
A statement that could be true, or false, depending on "what's in the box",
(see Schrodinger cat), or more in general on the meaning at a deeper level.

## Anchoring Bias
Relying too heavily:
- on a particular reference point, an "anchor",
- on the first piece of information received
to influence your decision making.

E.g.: something on sale, see before / after price.

If you see only the after price alone, it would not influence your decision
making the same.

## Recency Bias
Basing your decision only on the most recent information.

## Herding Bias

Follow the crowd instead of making decisions independently.

E.g.:
- invest in crypto.

## Survivorship Bias

Only look at a small biased sample of a population to make conclusions about the
general population. The sample are the "survivors".

## Sunk cost fallacy

Enduring in a strategy that results in money loss, only because we have
invested largely into it, even if it is clear that stopping that strategy would
be more beneficial.

## Straw man fallacy

Refute an argument, only by addressing a wrong, weak or distorted version of it:

- extremize the argument
- using edge cases
- using exceptions as the normality
- simplifying too much
