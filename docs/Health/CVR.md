# CVR (Cardio Vascular risks)

## Biomarkers

### #APOB

(Lipo Protein) - #Peter_Attia

- apoB is a far superior measurement than LDL-C when trying to predict CVR
- The best biomarker we have for CVR
- Total concentration of all particles capable of inducing atherosclerosis
- Ideal level around 20 - 30
- Late 30 - ceiling of 60 - should be below this

### CRP (c-reactive protein)

CRP is high when consuming high fructose.
CRS is a marker of inflammation and a predictor of cardiovascular events and
stroke.

### Troponin

Heart muscle protein - when the blood level is high it means that some protein
leaked in the blood.

It indicate a possible heart disease like infarction.
It is also high after a prolonged endurance activity.
