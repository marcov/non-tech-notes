# Migraine

Sequence:

1. Trigger
2a. Serotoninergic neurons release serotonin 5-HT
2a. Noradrenergic neurons release norephedrine aka noradrenaline (NA) (whose precursor is Dopamine)
3. Vasoconstricion & inflammation
4. Trigeminal nerve releases CGRP
5. Vasodilatation

Hence there's a correlation b/w migraine and the release of:

- Serotonin 5-HT
- CGRP
- Dopamine / NA

## CGRP - Calcitonine gene related peptide

- Increased level of this peptide are found during migraines
- Released by trigeminal nerve. Produced by neurons.
- Vasodilatator

## Drugs

### CRGP antagonis: Gepant
- most promising rimegepant - Nurtec
- risk of liver toxicity

### Serotonin Antagonist - Triptans
Antagonist for serotonin receptors

### Serotonin Antagonist - Ditans
